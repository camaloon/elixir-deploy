# Goals:

âœ“ Create a minimal elixir project that works locally
- Be able to deploy an elixir project
- deploy with git push (we don't want to have ssh access to the server)
- support hot upgrades
- if we use a db, we'd like migrations to run automatically
- (extra extra extra): build infrastructure on demand
